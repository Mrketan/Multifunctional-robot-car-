1]With the increase of technological advancements, everyone wants multitask-enabled products. In the past,  numerous robotic cars were built to perform certain type of tasks. With this project, a wide scope of  capacities is incorporated into a solitary model of a military automated vehicle, industrial used ,household  purpose and many more. The multi-functional robot consist multiple features we control this robot thorough  mobile application which we design this app with the help of MIT APP INVENTOR . In this robot we can  control the robot through smartphone and also we shift this robot into obstacle avoiding mode through  mobile in a single click . 
2]When it is shifted to Obstacle Avoiding mode it detect the obstacle in front of him  and change the path easily to avoid the obstacle. This also has a features of line follower or we can also say  that it follows a track. We add the 1838 IR sensor because of this we can not only control the robot thorough  smartphone but also it can control by an transmitter remote. The aim of this project is to develop a prototype  of a Multi-functional robot car that performs a various function in order to provide a very powerful and  versatile robot while also reducing the hardware usage as much as possible. In this project, Arduino UNO is  used as a central component, to which all the other components are interfaced. The designed vehicle is  controlled wirelessly through a smartphone with the help of a Bluetooth module.
